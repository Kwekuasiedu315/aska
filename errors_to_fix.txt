Dear Customer Support Team,

I tried to sign up for Oracle's Free Cloud services using my Visa prepaid card for charge authorization, but my account creation was declined because my card is prepaid. I would like to know if there is a way for me to create an account using a prepaid card or if there is another payment method that I can use to sign up.

Additionally, I was charged 0.93 euros for the failed account creation. Could you please refund this amount to my prepaid card as soon as possible?

Thank you for your attention to this matter, and I look forward to hearing back from you soon.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
